The design requirements and constraints of the project are determined by following the performance, deadline and safety requirements of the 2016 UAV Challenge, and also self-imposed constraints and requirements. For this task the required flight time, distance and maximum weight for a classification were selected as the starting parameters for the calculations.\\

Secondary objectives included the prioritization of low cost development, as well as use of readily available components and materials. The ranking of the priority of objectives is define as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{High Priority:} Primary objective of the project.
	\item \textbf{Medium Priority:} Objectives that result in performance specifications (treated negotiable).
	\item \textbf{Low Priority:} Not of primary concern, but to be addressed where feasible.
	\item \textbf{Competition Priority:} Important objectives to compete in competition, but out of this years scope.
\end{itemize}

The formulation of objectives, requirements and constraints provide the performance specificiations that are used as a foundation for the selection of motor, propellor and battery components.
