The UAV Challenge is a competition held every 2 years where teams enter their UAV for the purpose of completing a autonomously search and rescuse type task.
This iteration of the challenge is titled ``Medical Express 2016'', whereby teams are tasked with using an unmanned aircraft to fly out to a known area through specific transit corridors, search and correctly identify ``Outback Joe'' by his blue jeans, land close to him, have Joe place his simulated blood sample within the aircraft and then have the aircraft fly back to base such that his blood sample can be analysed.\\

The time period of the competition extends from registration (before 2nd September, 2015) to final competition (week starting 19th of September, 2016), spanning over 1 year. The following table highlights the key dates and corresponding events of the 2016 UAV Challenge.\\
