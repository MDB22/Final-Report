A T-3 configuration was selected over a T-6 configuration, as it would lead to a lighter and cheaper aircraft. However, the aircraft was designed to be capable of being 'upgraded' to a T-6 configuration if the need arose.\\
Three motors would provide lift in VTOL mode, the front two motors being mounted vertically utilizing a mounting system capable of being rotated forwards $90^{\circ}$ to facilitate the transition system and fixed-wing flight. The rear motor mount system was designed to be tilted laterally through the use of a servo-motor to enable the yaw mechanism of the aircraft.\\
To enable proper mounting of all motors and mounting systems, custom prototyping using 3D printed parts were designed to fit within the X-8 flying frame. The major components of which are split up into the `Front  Mounting System' and the `Back Mounting System'.\\
Front Mounting System needed to incorporate the transition system.
Back Mounting System needed to incorporate the yaw servo-motor system....
