\subsection{Flight Tests}
\label{sec:diary}
The Gantt chart cannot fully express the amount of ongoing testing (including flight tests) and iterative design that was performed every week of each semester. Table \ref{tab:tests} documents all major external tests and pre-flight checks performed on the Dragonfly (Prototype \#2) aircraft throughout the year; for brevity, there are a large number of minor tests that are not included in the table.

\subsection{Project Diary}
The team has made extensive use of Trello to maintain records of the tasks performed throughout the project. The project's records/diary may be viewed in full detail here: \url{https://trello.com/uavoutbackchallenge2016}.

\subsection{Project Timeline}

\subsection{Major Problems and Issues}
Throughout the year, there were a number of problems that significantly delayed the progress of the project. The Gantt chart provides some details regarding the time delay as a result of each problem.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Vibrations and stability: In semester 1, more time than initially planned was spent on eliminating vibrations and increasing stability of the aircraft. 
	
	\item Printer repair: Many hours have been spent fixing and tweaking the 3D printer.  During the holidays, a week of testing and repair was done to fix an issue with clogged nozzles. See gant chart xxx
	
	\item Multiple crashes: Crashes throughout the year required the purchase of replacements parts, and corresponding delays due to shipping time. Large amounts of time were then spent re-testing components. All major crashes were due to faulty hardware such as the power module, RC transceiver and failure of a motor, resulting in the fixed-wing flight controller not being fully tested. See Gantt chart and flight tests xxx.
	
	\item Team Member Departure: As a result of family issues, Shanon was unable to make meaningful contributions after semester 1 (including mid year break), particularly during the final weeks before the submission of final report. Several sections of the Gantt chart remain incomplete as a result of this.
\end{itemize}
