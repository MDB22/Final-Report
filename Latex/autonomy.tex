\subsection{Software Development}
Any aircraft participating in the UAV Challenge must be autonomous, only interacting with a human to be armed or disarmed at the beginning and end of the mission. A framework for autonomous flight was developed in Python for the Raspberry Pi, based on the following considerations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Extendibility:} Software is designed so that future teams can easily add functionality to the autonomous systems
	\item \textbf{Concurrency:} Software launches several parallel processes, enabling real-time interaction between the many subsystems of the aircraft and software
	\item \textbf{Low-Latency:} All processes must have little to no delay in communication, allowing for real-time operation 
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:softwarearchitecture} shows the software architecture for the autonomous flight and intelligence systems implemented on the Raspberry Pi, consisting of a number of parallel processes, two objects to monitor the state of the aircraft, and objects to facilitate inter-process communication. Each process shown in Figure \ref{fig:softwarearchitecture} performs a specific function:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Autopilot:} Acts as an interface to pass flight commands from the UAV software to the PixHawk, and to monitor and respond to sensor data
	\item \textbf{Flight:} Generates the desired flight path for the aircraft, and sends flight commands to the Autopilot process
	\item \textbf{UAVStateUpdater:} Monitors and updates the state of the aircraft by interfacing with internal sensors, including GPS, accelerometer, etc; manages the UAVState object that stores sensor data
	\item \textbf{WorldStateUpdater:} Monitors and updates the state of the world by interfacing with external sensors, including camera, LiDAR and ultrasonic; manages the WorldState object that stores sensor data
	\item \textbf{BaseCommunications:} Provides a real-time data link between the aircraft and the ground station
	\item \textbf{Logging:} Retrieves data from other modules and generates flight logs for reviewing mission performance
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:softwareinteraction} shows the communication paths between the various processes. As a result of the multiprocessing framework, communication between modules is not as simple as passing variables through functions. Instead, whenever two or more processes communicate with each other, a dedicated ``link'' needs to be created between them. Pipes (blue in Figure \ref{fig:softwareinteraction}) allow for bidirectional communication between processes, such as between the Flight and Autopilot. Queues (green in Figure \ref{fig:softwareinteraction}) only allow unidirectional communication, such as between all processes and the Log process, which only needs to receive information.\\

One of the biggest dangers in parallel processing communication is data corruption or loss; one process attempts to read data from a link while another is modifying it or writing to it, resulting in the data becoming unusable. To prevent this, each process that connects with either a pipe or queue is provided with read and write ``locks''. When activated, the lock will prevent other processes from reading from, or writing to, the communication link before the current process has completed its operation.

\subsection{Testing}
\subsubsection*{Software in the Loop}
Before being implemented on the prototype aircraft, the autonomous flight modules were first tested in a simulated aircraft using ArduPilot's Software in the Loop capabilities \cite{ref:sitl}. Figure \ref{fig:sitl} shows a screenshot of the Software in the Loop testing. The virtual aircraft was successfully tested with the software discussed above, executing a simple mission consisting of a series of \textbf{M1} commands; takeoff to 10m, forward flight of 10m, and landing.

\subsubsection*{Substitute Aircraft}
After the successful SITL test, the autonomous flight systems were validated by performing the automated takeoff and landing procedure on a separate aircraft that was also powered by a PixHawk flight controller; the Y650 model, shown in Figure \ref{fig:Y650}, was chosen as it has performed several dozen hours of successful flight. The Y650 was able to successfully execute the flight plan above, providing a proof-of-concept for the autonomous flight controls.
