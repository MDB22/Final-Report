\section{Remaining Sections}
\red{The main argument will begin with a section describing your team's major activities, leading to the fulfillment of the objectives of your project.  A flow chart will provide a useful visual aid.

Introduce the tasks that you were required to complete to satisfy the agreed project scope. Itemise tasks whenever possible to assist cross-referencing with following sections (i.e. your contributions).

Describe the development your ideas and strategies, the conceptual design and research methods used (as applicable), and why they were chosen (your literature review will be of value here).  

Discuss any original contributions including, for example, modifications or extensions of published methods or associated knowledge.  Your team may have made a more humble, but still valuable, contribution, where you customised an existing method for your specific application.  Describe the benefits and, if applicable, deficiencies associated with your contributions.

The criteria against which preferred concepts are identified should be discussed.  This aspect of your report, appropriately sectioned, will make extensive use of pictorial information (figures) and organised information (lists and tables).  

The details of completed analyses and supporting calculations can be included in an Appendix, referred to, as required, from the main body of the report.  Summaries, flow charts identifying methodologies, and sample calculations should be included in the main body of the report.
