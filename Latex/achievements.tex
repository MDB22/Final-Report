\red{WHAT DOES OUR AIRCRAFT BRING TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Low cost autonomous aircraft (compare to Sony, defence drones, DJI and Parrot)
	\item Hybrid aircraft with transition capability (novel flight capabilities)
	\item Long range AND long flight time in a single unit (best of both aircraft)
	\item Foundations for intelligent drone flight (not just ``follow me'' behaviour)
	\item Achieved \textbf{M1} flight, with the capability of \textbf{M2} with successful transition, and \textbf{M3} with the installation of sensors
	\item Uncountable applications beyond medical transport (list)
\end{itemize}}
