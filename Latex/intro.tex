This project is titled ``Hybrid UAV Development for Emergency Response'', it is a sub-division project of Melbourne Autonomous Search and Rescue (MASR). MASR is a official entrant into the UAV  Challenge - Medical Express 2016.\\

The UAV project entails the design and development of a fully custom UAV which is able to autonomously survey an area and perform search and rescue actions. Specifically, Team CP-CBU-155 was responsible for the development of mechanical design, flight controls, autonomous decision making software, novel sensing method, integration as well as operational roles of developed UAVs.\\

The primary objectives of the project were the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Develop a UAV system to meet challenge requirements
	\item Achieve a functional UAV (that is to be continued on by next years team)
	\item Introduce design novelty \\
\end{enumerate}

A successful UAV capable of search and rescue applications will incorporate the following features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Payload receipt and transportation back to base
	\item Automated target identification of an uncommon (non high-visibility) target
	\item Capacity to switch between Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) and traditional fixed-wing flight modes
	\item Capacity to switch between automated and manual flight modes through user commands
	\item A total flight travel distance of at least 60km
	\item A total flight duration of at least 60 minutes\\
\end{itemize}

This years team was tasked to provide a solid starting point for which next years team can build upon to realise the challenge requirements and goals. Specific deliverables were selected by the team to develop throughout the year in order to realise UAV Challenge objectives.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Transition System:} The development of a novel transistion system which allows the aircraft to switch between VTOL and fixed-wing flight modes
	\item \textbf{Flight Autonomy:} The development, documentation and implementation of automated flight controls
	\item \textbf{Object Detection and Avoidance:} The development of a low-cost medium range sensor system to enable object detection and path routing
\end{itemize}
