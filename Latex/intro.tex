This project is titled ``Hybrid UAV Development for Emergency Response''. This project is being completed under MAS (Melbourne Autonomous Systems); MAS is the official entrant into the UAV  Challenge Medical Express 2016. \color{red} The project entails the design and development of a novel, hybrid UAV, which is capable of autonomous flight \color{black}. \\

The primary objectives of the project were the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Develop a UAV system to meet the requirements of the UAV Challenge
	\item Achieve a functional UAV prototype, to be developed further in 2016
	\item Introduce design novelty \\
\end{enumerate}

A successful UAV capable of search and rescue applications will incorporate the following features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Payload receipt and transportation back to base
	\item Automated target identification of an uncommon (non high-visibility) target
	\item Capacity to switch between Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) and traditional fixed-wing flight modes
	\item Capacity to switch between automated and manual flight modes through user commands
	\item A total flight travel distance of at least 60km
	\item A total flight duration of at least 60 minutes\\
\end{itemize}

This years team was tasked to provide a solid starting point for which next years team can build upon to realise the challenge requirements and goals. Specific deliverables were selected by the team to develop throughout the year in order to realise UAV Challenge objectives.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Transition System:} The development of a novel transistion system which allows the aircraft to switch between VTOL and fixed-wing flight modes
	\item \textbf{Flight Autonomy:} The development, documentation and implementation of automated flight controls
	\item \textbf{Object Detection and Avoidance:} The development of a low-cost medium range sensor system to enable object detection and path routing
\end{itemize}

WHAT DOES OUR AIRCRAFT BRING TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY
\begin{itemize}
	\item Low cost autonomous aircraft
	\item Hybrid flight modes
	\item Long range AND long flight time in a single unit
	\item Intelligent drone flight (not just ``follow me'' behaviour)
	\item Uncountable applications beyond medical transport
\end{itemize}
