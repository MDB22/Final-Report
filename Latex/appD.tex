Research suggests that a Y6 configuration, with 3 sets of 2 coaxial motors (2 pairs at the front, 1 at the rear), is the best setup for this task, as shown on the FireFLY6 in Figure 7 above. However, due to its weight and construction, this is not possible on the 2014 model. Instead, it will have to be fitted in quadrotor formation, with four motors and rotors attached under the fuselage (Figure 4). To hover the aircraft (22kg) with 4 (3.5kg) motors equipped with 10cm propellers, in air with density 1.168 kg/m3 would require\\

$P=v_{air}*F_{thrust}=\sqrt{F{thrust}/(\rho_air*\pi*r_prop^2)}*F_thrust=F_thrust^{3/2}/\sqrt{\rho_air*\pi*r_prop^2}=(mg)^{3/2}/\sqrt{N_motors^3*\rho_air*\pi*r_prop^2=2500W}$\\

This requirement is per motor, under ideal conditions (100 percent motor and rotor efficiency). A cost effective motor for this is the Turnigy RotoMax, which cost 90AUD on sale at HobbyKing, bringing the cost of motors alone to 360AUD. However, more significant is that 75A is required per motor (combined current of 300A) along with a 10 cell (3.7V) battery.  The most cost effective battery at HobbyKing capable of this is the Turnigy Nano-Tech 4400mah Lipo Pack at 81AUD. With 4 motors at 75 Amps, this battery will last approximately
$t_{batt}=36004400/475=53s$\\

Assuming a single take-off/landing manoeuvre can takes at most tbatt, we would require four batteries to complete the challenge, costing 324AUD in total, with total extra weight of 4.8kg. However, we would require even more power to complete the fixed-wing, 10km flight to find Joe.\\

In addition to cost, the modifications necessary to make such a plane would be significantly harder, as the supports would need to hold a lot more weight, and the plane itself is made of wood and not foam. The design of the craft (as both a quadcopter and fixed wing aircraft) on the larger craft would have a significant amount of aerodynamic drag and be less efficient.\\

Last year’s project was designed with a separate scope in mind, with a very different challenge where VTOL was not required It was also designed as a multi-platform craft, where the fixed wing was designed to manufacture, something we certainly don’t plan on doing this year with the wing. With consideration to all of the above points, we believe that purchasing a foam model airframe to build off is the best course of action for the 2015 development.
