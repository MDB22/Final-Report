-briefly What they did last year (wes) 
-Disproof (need to find that one we made matt)

Matt: I still don't think we need this section, at least not in the main body. It was necessary for Project 1, but has had no influence on the project since then. Appendix A seems like a good spot.
Wes: Agreed on the not needing this section, didn't really effect us throughout the year, as we basically started anew.
